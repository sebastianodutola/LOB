Perfect — that’s the right mindset. Two days means you need to maximise perceived sophistication per hour of work — not build a perfect simulator.

Here’s a realistic, high-impact priority plan, tailored for your existing codebase and timeline.

⚡ PRIORITY LIST (2-Day Upgrade Plan)

🥇 1. Fix the “free money” flaw (highest impact, ~3 hrs)

Right now your market maker can’t lose because fills are guaranteed and price has no drift.
Fix that and you instantly make it look like a real backtest.

Quick implementation:
	•	Introduce a stochastic mid-price:

price_t += np.random.normal(0, sigma_price)
order_flow.base_price = price_t


	•	Let order flow prices be drawn around that base.
	•	The market maker now faces adverse price movement → inventory matters.

✅ Result: Strategy now produces variable PnL — looks real, not rigged.

⸻

🥈 2. Add simple performance analytics (2 hrs)

Recruiters love metrics. Even basic analytics make your results look like “quant research.”

Implement:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "t": np.arange(timesteps),
    "pnl": pnl,
    "inventory": inventory,
    "mid": mids
})

Then compute:

mean_pnl = df.pnl.mean()
sharpe = df.pnl.diff().mean() / df.pnl.diff().std() * np.sqrt(252)
max_drawdown = (df.pnl.cummax() - df.pnl).max()

and plot:
	•	PnL curve
	•	Inventory over time
	•	Histogram of inventory

✅ Result: One slide’s worth of quant-style results.

⸻

🥉 3. Add simple inventory risk control (1–2 hrs)

Make your market maker behave intelligently rather than symmetrically.

Modify strategy:
	•	When inventory > 0, quote slightly wider on the bid and tighter on the ask.
	•	When inventory < 0, do the opposite.

Example:

spread_adj = 0.01 * (self.inventory / self.inventory_limit)
bid = round(order_book.best_bid + tick - spread_adj, 2)
ask = round(order_book.best_ask - tick + spread_adj, 2)

✅ Result: Looks like a real adaptive quoting model.

⸻

🪶 4. Improve visuals & presentation (2 hrs)

You’ll get huge perceived value from clear output and a polished README.
	•	Plot midprice, bid/ask, and market maker quotes (use different colors).
	•	Add 2–3 concise bullet points in README:
	•	“Implements Level-3 LOB with price–time priority”
	•	“Poisson order flow with stochastic midprice”
	•	“Market-making strategy with adaptive spread and inventory control”
	•	Include 2–3 plots as figures.
	•	End with: “This project demonstrates microstructure-level trading logic and backtesting for a market-making strategy.”

✅ Result: Visually professional, ready for GitHub / interview.

⸻

🧠 5. (Optional if time left, 2–3 hrs)

Add parameter sensitivity analysis:
Run 3 simulations with different σ (price volatility) and plot PnL distributions side-by-side.

✅ Result: Instantly looks like “research” and gives you talking points like

“As volatility increases, the maker’s spread capture is offset by inventory risk.”

📅 Suggested Schedule

Time	Task	Deliverable
Morning Day 1	Add stochastic price dynamics	Non-deterministic PnL
Afternoon Day 1	Analytics + plots	PnL curve, Sharpe, drawdown
Morning Day 2	Adaptive quoting (inventory control)	Smoothed inventory
Afternoon Day 2	README + visuals + short demo video	GitHub-ready project
(Optional evening)	Run sensitivity experiment	3 plots + short comment

🎯 After this upgrade

Your project will:
	•	Have realistic market behaviour (price drift, inventory risk)
	•	Produce quant-style analytics and visuals
	•	Demonstrate both engineering and trading intuition
	•	Be polished enough to drop straight into your CV or GitHub

If you want, I can sketch the README structure (sections, figure layout, short technical intro paragraph) so you can paste it directly tomorrow.
